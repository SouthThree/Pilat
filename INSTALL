1) Requirements

To use PILAT, we strongly recomment to install the Ocaml package manager OPAM.
To install it from ubuntu, just type 'sudo apt-get install opam'.
 
-- With OPAM --

   a) opam install frama-c 
   Pilat is part of the Frama-C framework.

   b) opam install lacaml
   This part is a little tricky, as you need to install two dependencies : BLAS
   and LAPACK. These are the matrix libraries used in Pilat.

   c) opam install zarith
   This package is used for our matrix implementation.

-- Without OPAM --

   a) Get the latest version of Ocaml	

   b) Download the Frama-C source on http://frama-c.com/ and unzip it.
      Then go to the main directory and run : 
	autoconf
	./configure
	make depend
	make
	sudo make install
	 
   c) For lacaml and zarith, you can find the sources in 
      http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/
      Just make sure to install the libraries at the same place than the folder
      containing "ocamlc".

2) Install

To install Pilat, go to src/ and run :
	autoconf
	./configure
	make depend
	make
	sudo make install

Run frama-c -pilat-h for the complete list of options (and to check Pilat is 
correctly installed)
