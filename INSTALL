1) Requirements

To use PILAT, we strongly recommend to install the Ocaml package manager OPAM.
To install it from ubuntu, just execute 'sudo apt-get install opam'. Then, 
initialize OPAM by executing 'opam init --comp 4.02.3' that will install 
OCaml 4.02.3.

-- With OPAM --

   a) opam install frama-c 

   b) opam install lacaml

   c) opam install zarith

-- Without OPAM --

   a) Get the latest version of Ocaml	

   b) Download the Frama-C source on http://frama-c.com/ and unzip it.
      Then go to the main directory and run : 
	autoconf
	./configure
	make depend
	make
	sudo make install

   c) Install the lapack library

   d) Install lacaml and zarith. You can find the sources in 
      http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/
      Just make sure to install the libraries at the same place than the folder
      containing "ocamlc".


2) Install

To install Pilat, go to src/ and run :
	autoconf
	./configure
	make depend
	make
	sudo make install

Run frama-c -pilat-h for the complete list of options (and to check Pilat is 
correctly installed)
